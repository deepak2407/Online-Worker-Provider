# Online-Worker-Provider

The main problem we are trying to solve here is people living in cities do not know where the workers are available. They search a lot or ask a lot for the worker details to get their work completed.
For example, a person wants a plumber,carpenterâ€¦
As their location or contact is not actively know by the consumer.

Proposed Solution:

Online Worker Provider System provides details of all the workers available in their locality. The system allows the customer to track and check worker availability and their wages. This system allows workers on daily or hourly or on a time based manner.
This system allows the workers to get information about their work. Workers will send an acknowledgment by accepting the customer request.
I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript for front end and used PHP and MySql for backend.
XAMPP is used for testing and developing local web server as it is simple and light weight.
